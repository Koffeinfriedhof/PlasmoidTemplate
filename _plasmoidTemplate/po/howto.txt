How to translate:

Example:
translate into german:

call:
./Messages.sh de

Running Messages.sh without an argument will create a template file called KOF_PLASMOID_NAME.pot.

Edit the plasma_applet_KOF_PLASMOID_NAME-de.po file and set corresponding msgstr.

After editing run ./Messages.sh without an argument. It will create a corresponding .mo-file

To install files you have either to install it using cmake; make; sudo make install
OR just copy your .mo-file to
/usr/local/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/plasma_applet_KOF_PLASMOID_NAME.mo

Other languages:
You just have to replace all "de"'s in this document to view an example in your language.
